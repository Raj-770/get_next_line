Certainly! Writing a README.md file is an essential part of any GitHub repository. Below is a template you can use for your Get Next Line project:

# Get Next Line

## Description

This project involves implementing the `get_next_line` function, which reads a line from a file descriptor and returns it. Repeated calls to `get_next_line` should allow reading a text file line by line.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile your code, use the following command, where `BUFFER_SIZE` is the buffer size for `read()` (e.g., 42 in this example):

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
```

### Function Prototype

```c
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```

### Buffer Size

You can modify the buffer size using the `-D BUFFER_SIZE=n` option in the compilation command.

### Handling Binary Files

The function has undefined behavior when reading a binary file, but you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

## Bonus Part

The bonus part of the project can manage multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

### Compilation for Bonus Part

To compile the bonus part, use a similar command with the `_bonus` suffix:

```bash
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>_bonus.c
```
